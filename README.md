# TheCodeMan .NET AI ToolKit

**44+ Claude skills and 7 specialist agents that make Claude Code an expert .NET developer** — running on *your* real code, not toy examples. EF Core, performance, architecture, testing, security, observability, DevOps. Built for modern **.NET 10 / C# 14**.

Curated by [Stefan Đokić — TheCodeMan](https://thecodeman.net), Microsoft MVP.

## ⚡ Install (one marketplace, two commands)

```shell
/plugin marketplace add StefanTheCode/dotnet-ai-toolkit
/plugin install dotnet-ai-toolkit@thecodeman-ai-toolkit
```

That's it. Skills trigger automatically when your request matches — e.g. *"optimize this EF query"*, *"scaffold a products endpoint"*, *"review this PR"* — and you invoke an agent by asking for what it does (*"audit the security of this API"*).

Update anytime:

```shell
/plugin marketplace update thecodeman-ai-toolkit
```

> Prefer manual install, or using these in Cowork? See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

## What's a skill vs. an agent?

**Skill** — a focused capability Claude loads automatically when your request matches it. Great for "do this specific thing well" (optimize a query, generate tests, set up auth).

**Agent** — a specialist reviewer with its own system prompt that explores your codebase and produces a report. Great for "look at my whole repo and tell me what's wrong" (architecture review, security audit, code review).

## Tools & templates

- 🛠️ **[CLAUDE.md Generator](tools/)** — an interactive tool that generates a tailored `CLAUDE.md` for your project. Pick your stack, architecture, conventions, and the patterns Claude should never suggest. Open `tools/claude-md-generator.html` in a browser.
- 📄 **[CLAUDE.md template](templates/dotnet-CLAUDE-md-template.md)** — a ready-made starting point you can drop into your repo root and fill in.

A `CLAUDE.md` at your repo root is what stops Claude from writing generic C# — it loads automatically at the start of every session.

## Want to go deeper?

This toolkit is the free, open layer. Inside the **[TheCodeMan AI ToolKit community](https://www.skool.com/thecodeman-ai-toolkit-9723)** I teach you, step by step, how to actually use AI in real .NET work — Claude Code workflows, building your own agents and skills, MCP servers in C#, and shipping AI features (RAG, agents) into your own apps. Live sessions and full courses, with members getting everything first.
